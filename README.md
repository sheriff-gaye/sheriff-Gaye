## About Me

I am a Software Engineer specializing in **Applied Machine Learning and AI-driven systems**.

My work focuses on transforming data into scalable, production-ready solutions that solve real-world problems. I operate at the intersection of:

- Intelligent systems  
- Backend architecture  
- Data-driven product development  

I build systems — not demos.

---

## Core Focus Areas

- End-to-end ML pipelines (data → modeling → deployment)
- AI-powered applications for emerging markets
- Scalable backend systems & APIs
- Data-centric system design
- Applied research in Machine Learning

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Clarity over complexity  
- Systems thinking over shortcuts  
- Measurable outcomes over hype  
- Depth over trend-chasing  

I aim to build technology that creates structural impact — not just technical noise.
